# cpp_examples
Here are some examples of useful classic C++ solutions. As useful as these have been for me, I would like to extend to you the efforts of yours truly. 

##### `"Truly a full scale professional level C++ example."`

## UPDATE:
### As of 02/28/21

* I plan on updating and adding to this indefinitely. I dont use C++ as much as I used to so, it might be a long road ahead but it will get done and be helpful.

* this is a simple cpp example, most of which I only use the standard library and I will continue to only use Native code, just because my real interests lie in algorithms and robotics, A.I. I suppose.

* If you would like to contribute to any of my projects let me know and I will certainly consider it.

* if you have any requests, feel free to comment or contact me. (email is in profile)


## What is this?

#### 1. It is a helpful tool that will get progressively get better.
#### 2. It is practice for me.
#### 3. This is also an attempt to include people in my projects.
#### 4. This is very educational for me as well.

## What does it include right now?

It currently includes: 
```
    {
      
      
      
      
      
    }

```


##### This half of the year:
  - `creating templates` 
  - `examples and explanations`
  - `compiler and preprocessor optimizations`
  - `garbage collection` 
  - `logging` 
  - `tests` 
  - `cmake`
  - `advanced C++ concepts` 
  - `up for suggestions`
  
# [in.the.future]

#### here is a little example of what is to come.
(I can definitely express what I'm trying to do with example code)

```
  //first we define the main function
  int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    if(argc){
      //handle argc
      //check out argv[]
    }
    
    //**endless loop to break upon desired result**//
    while(true){
      
      //choose what input and file type data should be brought in through
      //    -read in data
      //    -evaluate -manipulate
      //    -categorize -sort
      
      //choose what to do with data
      //    -neural network
      //    -machine learning
      //    -data mapping
      //    -data science
      //    -...etc
      //...then do it.
      
      //record data and mapping of all memory transactions
      //    -output data to file
      //    -feed data to other system/program/network
      //    -live feed of data updates
      
      //create complete website with C++
      
      //serve it with NODE, NGINX, LINUX-UBUNTU with digitalOcean
      
      //display live feed of progress of the neural network learning, and becoming more accurate.
      
      //display several algorithms side-by-side on a live feed of the time complexity, and several data
      //aspects that can and will be implemented. (this will not be public at first. you will have to
      //subscribe)
     
    }
  }

```
