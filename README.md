# cpp_examples
all of my cpp examples and boilerplates I've made over the years

##UPDATE:

* I plan on updating and adding to this indefinitely. I dont use C++ as much as I used to so, it might be a long road ahead but it will get done and be helpful.

* this is a simple cpp example, most of which I only use the standard library and I will continue to only use Native code, just because my real interests lie in algorithms and robotics, A.I. I suppose.

* If you would like to contribute to any of my projects let me know and I will certainly consider it.

* if you have any requests, feel free to comment or contact me. (email is in profile)
